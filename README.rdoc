== DAPP

This prototypical app was developed by Michael Thompson and visually designed by Parteek Saran at the iOSDevCamp hackathon. The goal was to make it easier for a doctor to view a diabetes patient's data. It provides an interface for health professionals to view a graph and table of a diabetes patient's recent readings. The app has an API for submitting insulin pump readings to. Ideally, this data would be automatically uploaded straight from the patient's insulin pump.

The automated test suite was not fleshed out due to time constraints of the weekend-long hackathon. This should be the first thing added if any more work is to be done on the app! It is just a prototype for demoing right now, and should not be used with real data.
